## 📄 File Structure
### 📌 File Name

The name is always set with the exercise number in the order that I developed plus the standard file extention of the programming language.
- Example: <01.c> 

### 📌 Content Structure

Each file has a header with:

- Problem name.
- Link to specific statement in [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/) website.

Bellow the header is the solution of the problem.

#### ✅ Complete Example:

```1000.c
/*
    Name: Hello World
    Link: https://judge.beecrowd.com/en/problems/view/1000
*/

#include <stdio.h>
 
int main() {

    printf("Hello World!\n");

    return 0;
}
```
